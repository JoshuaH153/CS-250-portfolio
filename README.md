How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs and translating them into  software programs involves actively engaging with users  to gain a deep understanding of their needs. Crafting user stories is instrumental in showing requirements and aiding prioritization. This approach ensures development aligns closely with user expectations.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
For future development I would be embracing methodologies like Scrum for iterative development for a structured framework. Breaking down projects into manageable tasks allows for regular reassessment, encouraging adaptability and responsiveness to feedback. Continuous improvement is emphasized through regular retrospectives, creating a culture that thrives on learning and collaboration.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a valuable team member in software development involves effective communication, both proactive and clear, with team members. Collaboration is essential, where sharing knowledge contributes to the growth of the entire team. Adaptability is crucial in a field where change is constant, and cultivating a mindset of continuous learning is very important.  Taking accountability for tasks and delivering on commitments, approaching challenges with a problem-solving mindset, and providing and receiving constructive feedback all contribute to the success of the team and the overall quality of the software developed. In essence, being a good team member in software development requires a blend of technical skills and interpersonal qualities, contributing to the collective success of the team.
